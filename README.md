# TWU Biblioteca
Biblioteca Ultimate Edition


## Instructions

In order for Biblioteca to run, you need java 1.6 and two external libraries: mockito 1.10.19 and objenesis 2.2. 
The .idea folder has been pushed to github as the instructions stated that should be. It will make opening the 
project in Intellij easier.

## Some useful data

Biblioteca will ask you for two fields: library number and password. Please, use these:
1. Library Number: 001-0001
2. Password: forloop.

In order to checkout or return an element, please select the title of one of them from the proper list.
